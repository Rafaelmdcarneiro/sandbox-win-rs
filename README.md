# Flying Sandbox Monster

A proof-of-concept application that sandboxes the Malware Protection engine in an AppContainer on Windows, written in Rust. Flying Sandbox Monster only supports 32-bit builds at this time. Note: there is some _trickery_ performed to make things work since this is a proof-of-concept that interfaces with an undocumented DLL.

 * Once complete, check that `support\mpengine.dll` exists, among other files.

### FAQ

#### `cargo build` complains that `msvc targets depend on msvc linker but "link.exe" was not found`

You need to install the [Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691126&fixForIE=.exe) or newer.
